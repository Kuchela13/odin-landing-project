# odin-landing-project
I decided to have a little fun with this project and drew inspiration from the fantasy world to create an online potions store. I'm sure many will immediately get the Harry Potter references but I'm not sure how many will know the character I'm referring to in the store's name. Florina is my favourite character from the Fire Emblem franchise, a novice Pegasus Knight from Fire Emblem 7-The Blazing Blade. She is widely considered to be lackluster compared to her two older sisters in the game but I've always been able to train her into one of my best, if not my best, characters. I'm a bit baised towards her as I like the idea of one of the frailer, less experienced combatants training up to become a force to be reckoned with and as such have never played through Blazing Blade without using her as a unit-which is saying a lot since I've played that game more than a dozen times.
